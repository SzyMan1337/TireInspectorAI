  "aboutContent": "Tires are one of the most crucial components of a vehicle. The only subsystem of a car that is in constant contact with the road is the tire subsystem. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the condition of the tires regularly. Tires have a significant impact on vehicle safety, including handling, braking, and overall performance. This application aims to assist in monitoring and detecting tire damage using advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nThis application was developed as part of a master's thesis titled 'Automatic Classification of Car Tire Condition Using Deep Learning Techniques' by Mateusz Szymański under the supervision of Dr. Janusz Rafałko.\n\nThis project uses an icon by surang from Freepik, available at: https://www.freepik.com/icon/inspection_4846000.",

  "localModelDescription": "The MobileNet model is specifically designed for efficiency on mobile devices. It's compact yet powerful enough to handle image processing tasks with a high degree of accuracy. Being optimized for low-power devices, it allows for fast, real-time operations directly on your device, making it ideal for applications that require immediate results without an internet connection.",
  "cloudModelDescription": "The ResNet model is known for its depth and accuracy in handling complex image recognition tasks. Operating from a cloud-based server, it utilizes extensive computational resources to analyze images, making it well-suited for applications where precision is critical. This model requires an active internet connection to upload images to the cloud, where processing occurs, and detailed results are sent back to the device.",
